# Email

## Mailboxes
41N uses [MXroute](https://mxroute.com) for hosting email for our domains. (so, `info@41n.co` would be processed by and land in a mailbox from MXroute.)

## Transactional
41N uses [MXroute](https://mxroute.com) for most transactional email for our projects. (so, if you receive a password reset email, notification, invoice, etc, that is most likely coming through MXroute.)

## Marketing
This is currently a placeholder section.
